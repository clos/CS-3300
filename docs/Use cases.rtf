\b0\fs24 \cf0 1. Professor tries to use Citrix.\
2. The system prompts the professor to log in\
3. login credentials are verified\
4. The GPS module checks the professor's current location\
5. This GPS co-ordinate data is checked against a remote database of valid geolocations\
6. The system verifies that the co-ordinate is acceptable.\
7. The user is logged into the system\

1) Invalid login\
	If in step 2 the user enters invalid/wrong information, display the error message "Invalid login" and exit\
2) No GPS connectivity\
	If the GPS module cannot be accessed to provide data in step 4, display message "check GPS module" and exit\
3) Garbled/incorrect GPS data\
	If the GPS module is malfunctioning in step 4, display message "check GPS module" and exit\
4) Invalid login location\
	If in step 5, the current GPS co-ordinates do not match with a valid location, display message "Please move to a secure / approved location before logging in" and exit\
5) Connection to Citrix servers fails\
	If in step 3, Citrix cannot be reached on the network, display "CITRIX server unreachable" and exit\
6) Connection to remote gps database fails\
	If in step 5, the database cannot be reached on the network, display "GPS server unreachable" and exit\

\b0\fs24 \cf0 1. Professor moves.\
2. The GPS module checks the professor's current location\

4. The system verifies that the co-ordinate is acceptable.\
5. The user remains logged into the system\

\b0 \
1) User moves to insecure location\
	If in step 1, the user moves outside of his "safe" bounds, this is detected in step 3, and in step 4, the user is booted out of the system. A message is also displayed saying "please remain in a secure location."\
\
2) GPS module loses connection\
	If during normal use, the gps module becomes unreachable, they lose connectivity, and a message is displayed stating that the user must reconnect the module before continuing.}
