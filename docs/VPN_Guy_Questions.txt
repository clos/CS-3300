VPN Guy Questions

1. How does the authentication work?
2. Is there any part of the process (i.e. a script) that would easily allow us to interrupt access or prevent authenticaiton? 
3. Where's the VPN server? Is it just a peace of software or hardware
4. What is its life cycle? How often is it updated?
5. How many users does/can the VPN have at any given time?
6. Is there any way to identify if the VPN is distributed by OIT?
7. How does authentication work in general (LDAP, AD, etc.)?
8. Is there any non-client documentation?
